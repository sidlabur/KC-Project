        Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of independent India laid
        the foundations of modern India. A man with modern scientific
        understanding put India onto the path of modernization. His contribution
        to building a strong India with democratic ethos cannot be denied by
        anyone. Nehru carried the burden of a newly independent country on his
        own shoulders and worked towards building a new India. He will always be
        remembered for his leadership and farsightedness by generations to come.
        <br />
        Here is a timeline of Mr.Nehru's life.
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            The First Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was born
            on November 14, 1889 to Swaroop Rani and Motilal Nehru in
            Pryagraj,India.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            His primary education was at his home only where tutors came to his
            house and took classes. At the age of 15 itself, Nehru went to
            England for his schooling. At the age of 17, Nehru joined Cambridge
            and completed his studies. After his return in 1912 Nehru directly
            joined Indian politics.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Returning from England and joining politics was a turning point in
            Nehru’s life. It was Gandhi who influenced and gave advice to Nehru
            on how independence can be achieved. His first political engagement
            was when he attended the Bankipore Congress in 1912. In 1919 he took
            the charge of the secretary of the home rule league. Nehru’s
            leadership quality became visible when he organized the first Kisan
            March in Uttar Pradesh in 1920.

              secretary of Annie Besant’s Home Rule League.
            </li>
            <li>
              He participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920 and led
              the movement in the United Province. He was arrested in 1921 for
              his anti- British activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Played an important role in the internationalization of the Indian
              Struggle for Independence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nehru was elected as the president of the Congress party during
              the Lahore session on 29 December 1929 and introduced a successful
              resolution calling for Swaraj.
            </li>
            <li>
              He was an important leader of the Civil Disobedience Movement in
              1930 and was arrested for the same.
            </li>

            <br />
          </ol>
          <li>
            In India’s Political History Nehru’s role is inevitable. Returning
            to India after his studies and till his death Nehru’s share in
            building a complete New India is massive. His long-term vision about
            the future of India has helped every government which came to power
            later. It was Nehru who bought together the rulers and people.
            Unlike today then the citizens of this country were the priority and
            it was all because of Nehru. As Ramachandra Guha notes Nehru was the
            connecting factor between the sovereign public and the middle class
            on one side and India and rest of the world on the other side.
